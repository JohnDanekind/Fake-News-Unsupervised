    "- Can unsupervised clustering naturally separate fake from real news without using labels?\n",
    "- What distinctive linguistic patterns emerge in clusters of fake vs. real news?\n",
    "- Are there identifiable sub-categories within fake news that clustering can reveal?\n",
    "- How do temporal patterns differ between fake and real news clusters?\n",
    "- Which textual features most strongly contribute to the separation of clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to think about\n",
    "- Dataset is meant for more supervised learning tasks (Neural nets, svms, knn, etc)\n",
    "- Maybe use KMeans, minhashing, and GMM's to cluster news into different categories\n",
    "- Compare these clusters to the labels later \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current plan since we have no time lmao\n",
    "- Make datasets into one big dataset with no labels.\n",
    "- Do K means on that data and cluster articles by similarity (could be jaccard, euclidean with vector embeddings, something else (figure out later))\n",
    "- See what patterns arise from this. \n",
    "- Then take the regular data set and do a simple supervised method that is interpretable. (Logistic regression, random forest. NO BLACK BOX)\n",
    "- Compare how each of the methods performed. \n",
    "- Can fake vs real news be clustered without explicit labels or is it harder to detect?"
